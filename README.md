# Model company - Dashboarding
Project using Mysql and PowerBI for the dataVIZ

Introduction

The company already has a database that lists employees, products, orders, and much more. You are invited to browse and discover this database. The director of the company wishes to have a dashboard which he could refresh each morning to have the latest information in order to manage the company.

The main developing axes where:
-Finance Department
-Logistics
-Human Resources
-Sales Department

KPIS where developed aiming to explore and better understand the different dimensions and informations stored in the given database.

Then, all sql scripts where imported in POWER BI for the dashboard realisation.
